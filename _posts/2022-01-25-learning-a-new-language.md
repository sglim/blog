The latest programming language that I've learned was a Dart to use Flutter in Dec, 2018 which is the official Flutter 1.0 release date.
Even though I tried to learn Elixir in 2021, but not enough to say that I learned.

Learning a new language is pretty helpful for me with several reasons.
The first language was C. C is really good language but it was not so kind for newbie.
Most of the preprocessor syntax is very helpful but little bit harsh for the newcomers.
That kind of little but critical barrier baffled me and the first grade was very difficult for me.

After suffering from the pointers, I learned Java as a class for sophomores.
At that time, the concept of OOP helped me to understand C well.
There was no pointers, no references. (They use it implicitly)
Every variables is called by value so it was easier to undersand than C.
With Java, I learned more complex and high concept like Design pattern.

Afrer learning design pattern, I was able to use some of them with C as well.
That was amazing experience and at that time I decide to learn many languages if possible.
So I've learned C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Prolog, Javascript, Swift, Kotlin, Typescript, and Dart.
The languages consist of me and I really thanks to the author of the languages.

Now, it is the time. The new language that I'll learn is **Rust**.
It would not be easy but I'll do my best.
