The lunar new year is the actual holiday in Korea.
Like the others on new year's Day, everybody sets the year's plan.

The plan is always significant and challenging to be achieved the year.
So I decided to list my dreams first, prioritize, and then choose among them.
Those goals can be very broad or narrow.

* Living in the country using English as a first language
* Preparing next generation
* Creating a small and fun company
* Doing art (I don't know what the art is anyway)
* Creating a project which is using Svelte
* Writing 100 posts in a year
* Creating a Youtube channel
* Learning a new language (Rust?)

The listing is the first step. I'll improve it later.
