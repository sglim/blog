# What do I need for my blog?

I'm using Jekyll now, and I'm an engineer. That means that I want to apply many things into my blog.

* Multiple language support (KR, EN)
* Google analytics to analyze inflow
* Way to show AD (Adsense? Admob?)
* Comment systen (Disqus?)
* Web service to write contents always (Codespace?)
* Text history
* Text diff tool (What is changed between histories?)
* Resume in about page

I'll follow up those things later but I already applied Google analytics with easiest way.
The Jekyll theme that I'm using is Minima, and it already supports Google analytics by just adding GA account id in `_config.yml`.

I'll try to find the tool to achieve my goal, but if nothing fits my needs, I'll develop one.
